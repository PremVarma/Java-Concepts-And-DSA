Creating a parking lot system involves several requirements and designing classes to represent various components of the system. Below is a detailed requirement analysis and the corresponding class diagram.

### Requirements Analysis

#### Functional Requirements
1. **Vehicle Entry and Exit:**
    - Vehicles can enter and exit the parking lot.
    - Track the time of entry and exit for billing purposes.

2. **Parking Spot Management:**
    - Different types of parking spots: Compact, Large, Handicapped, etc.
    - Ability to check the availability of parking spots.
    - Assign a parking spot to a vehicle upon entry.

3. **Billing:**
    - Calculate parking charges based on the time spent in the parking lot.
    - Support different pricing strategies (hourly, daily, etc.).

4. **User Management:**
    - Users can have different roles such as Admin, Attendant, and Customer.
    - Admin can add, remove, or update parking spots.
    - Attendants can manage vehicle entry and exit.

5. **Notifications:**
    - Notify users when the parking lot is full.
    - Notify users about the availability of parking spots.

6. **Parking Ticket:**
    - Generate a ticket upon vehicle entry.
    - Ticket contains information like entry time, parking spot ID, and vehicle details.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Scalability:** Should support a large number of vehicles and parking spots.
2. **Reliability:** Should be highly available and handle concurrent entries and exits efficiently.
3. **Security:** Ensure only authorized personnel can manage the parking lot.

### Class Diagram

Let's break down the class diagram into key components:

1. **Vehicle:** Represents a vehicle entering the parking lot.
2. **ParkingSpot:** Represents different types of parking spots.
3. **ParkingLot:** Manages the overall parking lot operations.
4. **ParkingTicket:** Represents the parking ticket issued to a vehicle.
5. **Payment:** Handles billing and payment processing.
6. **User:** Represents different types of users interacting with the system.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Vehicle Class:**
    - `licensePlate`: Unique identifier for the vehicle.
    - `type`: Type of vehicle (e.g., car, bike, truck).

2. **ParkingSpot Class:**
    - `number`: Unique identifier for the parking spot.
    - `type`: Type of parking spot (e.g., compact, large, handicapped).
    - `isAvailable`: Boolean indicating if the spot is available.

3. **ParkingTicket Class:**
    - `ticketNumber`: Unique identifier for the ticket.
    - `vehicle`: Vehicle associated with the ticket.
    - `entryTime`: Time of entry.
    - `exitTime`: Time of exit.
    - `parkingSpot`: Parking spot assigned to the vehicle.

4. **Payment Class:**
    - `amount`: Amount to be charged.
    - `paymentMethod`: Method of payment (e.g., cash, credit card).

5. **User Class:**
    - `name`: Name of the user.
    - `role`: Role of the user (e.g., admin, attendant, customer).

6. **ParkingLot Class:**
    - `name`: Name of the parking lot.
    - `address`: Address of the parking lot.
    - `parkingSpots`: List of parking spots.
    - `tickets`: List of parking tickets.
    - `users`: List of users.

### Implementation Strategy

- **Entry Process:**
    - Vehicle enters.
    - Check for available spot.
    - Assign spot and issue a ticket.
    - Notify if the parking lot is full.

- **Exit Process:**
    - Vehicle exits.
    - Calculate parking fee.
    - Process payment.
    - Free up the parking spot.

This design ensures that the parking lot system is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain. Each class has a single responsibility, making the system extensible for future enhancements.
